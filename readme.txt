Super easy socket wrapper, only compatible with TCP. 
I have used it in various multithreaded asynchronous applications and it has held up rather well.
I'm not going to post example code for this, so if you need help, please email and I will attempt to assist you.
This is a small side project I did in my spare time, and will not be maintained, if someone wants to take it over, feel free to email me.
